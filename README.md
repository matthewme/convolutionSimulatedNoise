# convolutionSimulatedNoise
This program adds noise to an image and convolution is performed to remove the noise.
I used 3 different types of masks; 3x3, 4x4, and 6x6.
Convolution is the process of going over an images pixels and replaceing them with an average.
The process will blurr the image a bit but it also removes the pixels with noise.
Not included are ImageIo.Java and Noise.Java because these were written by my instrcutor.
ImageIo.java are the read and write methods for turning the byte data into an image.
Noise.Java adds noise to image.
